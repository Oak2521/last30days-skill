## Research Execution

### PRECONDITION GATE - read before running the script

**STOP. Before invoking `last30days.py`, verify ALL of the following are true for this turn:**

1. **Platform branch chosen.** You know whether this session has WebSearch (Claude Code) or does not (OpenClaw, raw CLI, Codex without web tools).
2. **If WebSearch IS available:** you MUST have run Step 0.55 (Pre-Research Intelligence - resolved subreddits, X handles, TikTok hashtags/creators, Instagram creators, GitHub user/repo where applicable) AND Step 0.75 (Query Planner - produced `QUERY_PLAN_JSON` with 2-4 subqueries). These are NOT optional. If either was skipped, return to that step now.
3. **If WebSearch is NOT available:** you MUST add `--auto-resolve` to the command instead. Do not attempt Steps 0.55 / 0.75 without WebSearch.
4. **The command you are about to run uses `--emit=compact`.** `--emit md` is a debugging/inspection mode and is DISALLOWED as the primary user-facing flow. If you find yourself about to run `--emit md`, stop and switch to `--emit=compact`.
5. **On WebSearch platforms the command MUST include `--plan 'QUERY_PLAN_JSON'`** plus every resolved handle/subreddit/hashtag/creator flag from Step 0.55. Omit only flags whose value was not resolvable.

**Degraded path (missing any of the above on a WebSearch platform) is a known regression shape. It produces bland 4-bullet summaries instead of rich synthesis. Do not take it.**

---

**Grok Bot X connector recipe (only when `LAST30DAYS_X_HOST_LANE=1` is exported - see the Grok Bot host rule in HOW TO INVOKE).** On a Grok Bot with the X connector, YOU fetch X through the connector before the engine command and hand the engine the file; the engine then calls no X backend, plans `x` in, and the footer's X provenance reads "X via X connector". Do this before the Step 1 command below.

1. **Calls (the connector's post-search tool, e.g. `search_posts_all`).** Window = the engine's date range (`--days`, default 30: `from` is today minus the day count, `to` is today). Depth count = 10 (`--quick`) / 30 (default) / 60 (`--deep`).
   - One `topic` call: the topic query plus `-is:retweet`, the window, and the depth count.
   - Per `--x-handle` handle: one `from` call (`from:<handle> -is:retweet`, 8 posts) and one `mention` call (`@<handle> -is:retweet`, 5 posts).
   - Per `--x-related` handle: one `related` call (`from:<handle> -is:retweet`, 3 posts).
   - If the tool rejects the window or count parameters, omit them, keep at most the depth count per call, and write `"status": "partial"` with `"error": "window-unsupported"`.
   - If the connector itself fails, write `"status": "error"` with `"calls": []` and a short category in `error`: `credits`, `not-connected`, or `unavailable` - never raw tool output, never an account or app id.
2. **Envelope.** Exactly these top-level fields; every post carries the eight flat fields and nothing else (no URLs, media, or author objects); at most the depth count per call. A fresh `generated_at` (the engine rejects an envelope older than 6 hours) and a `topic` identical to the engine's topic string:

```json
{
  "schema": "last30days-x-posts/1",
  "generated_at": "{ISO_8601_UTC_NOW}",
  "topic": "{TOPIC}",
  "window": {"from": "{YYYY-MM-DD}", "to": "{YYYY-MM-DD}"},
  "provider": "x-connector",
  "status": "ok",
  "calls": [
    {"lane": "topic", "handles": [], "posts": [
      {"id": "1963000000000000000", "author_handle": "someone", "created_at": "2026-09-07T10:00:00Z", "text": "post text", "likes": 12, "reposts": 3, "replies": 1, "quotes": 0}
    ]},
    {"lane": "from", "handles": ["{RESOLVED_HANDLE}"], "posts": []},
    {"lane": "mention", "handles": ["{RESOLVED_HANDLE}"], "posts": []},
    {"lane": "related", "handles": ["{RELATED_HANDLE}"], "posts": []}
  ]
}
```

   Omit the `from` / `mention` / `related` calls when the run has no `--x-handle` / `--x-related`; `handles` must be the run's own handles. `id` is the post's numeric id as a string; `author_handle` is the username without `@`.
3. **Write the file - post text is attacker-controlled and never goes unquoted into a shell command.** Use the tool's own file output when it has one; otherwise a single-quoted heredoc (never unquoted) into a `.json` path outside `~/.config`, in the SAME Bash call as the engine command (the trap removes it on exit). Two rules keep a post from closing the heredoc early: emit the envelope as ONE line of compact JSON (newlines inside post text stay escaped as `\n`; never pretty-print), and replace `{X_POSTS_NONCE}` in BOTH sentinel lines with 12 random letters and digits you generate fresh for this run, so no post text can equal the closing line:

```bash
X_POSTS_DIR=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/last30days-x-posts.XXXXXX")
X_POSTS_FILE="$X_POSTS_DIR/x-posts.json"
trap 'rm -rf "$X_POSTS_DIR"' EXIT
cat >| "$X_POSTS_FILE" <<'X_POSTS_EOF_{X_POSTS_NONCE}'
{X_POSTS_ENVELOPE_JSON}
X_POSTS_EOF_{X_POSTS_NONCE}
```

   Run it directly in your shell tool, never wrapped in `bash -lc '...'` (same rule as the plan tmpfile).
4. **Engine.** Add `--x-posts "$X_POSTS_FILE"` to the Step 1 command (the file path only, never inline JSON); every other flag stays as usual. Comparison runs: write one envelope per entity (its `topic` is that entity's name) and put the path in that entity's `--competitors-plan` entry as `"x_posts": "/abs/path/x-posts.json"`; a bare `--x-posts` on a comparison run exits 2. If the engine exits 2 naming the envelope, fix the file it names or re-run without `--x-posts`; X is then absent for that run.
5. **After the run.** The stats line reads "X via X connector". The engine's one receipt line (accepted / dropped counts, on stderr) is diagnostics only: never narrate it in the deliverable (subject to the host/user output requirements).

**Step 1: Run the research script WITH your query plan (FOREGROUND)**

**CRITICAL: Run this command in the FOREGROUND with a 5-minute timeout. Do NOT use run_in_background. The full output contains Reddit, X, AND YouTube data that you need to read completely.**

**IMPORTANT: Pass your QUERY_PLAN_JSON via the --plan flag. This tells the Python script to use YOUR plan instead of calling Gemini.**

**IMPORTANT: Include `--x-handle={RESOLVED_HANDLE}` in the command. For comparison mode: Pass `--x-handle={TOPIC_A_HANDLE}` to the first pass, `--x-handle={TOPIC_B_HANDLE}` to the second pass, and both to the head-to-head pass. Also include `--subreddits={RESOLVED_SUBREDDITS}`, `--tiktok-hashtags={RESOLVED_HASHTAGS}`, `--tiktok-creators={RESOLVED_TIKTOK_CREATORS}`, and `--ig-creators={RESOLVED_IG_CREATORS}` from Step 0.55. Omit any flag where the value was not resolved (empty).**

```bash
# SKILL_DIR = absolute path of the directory containing THIS SKILL.md you just Read.
# Substitute the actual path below — your harness told you where this file lives via
# the Read tool result. Examples:
#   Read ~/.claude/skills/last30days/SKILL.md      → SKILL_DIR=$HOME/.claude/skills/last30days
#   Read ~/.codex/skills/last30days/SKILL.md       → SKILL_DIR=$HOME/.codex/skills/last30days
#   Read ~/.claude/plugins/cache/last30days-skill/last30days/3.11.0/skills/last30days/SKILL.md
#     → SKILL_DIR=$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/last30days-skill/last30days/3.11.0/skills/last30days
# scripts/last30days.py is always a direct child of SKILL_DIR (every install layout
# packages SKILL.md and scripts/ as siblings).
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the SKILL.md you Read>"

if [ ! -f "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/last30days.py" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: scripts/last30days.py not found under SKILL_DIR=$SKILL_DIR" >&2
  echo "Re-check the directory of the SKILL.md you Read and substitute it as SKILL_DIR above." >&2
  exit 1
fi

"${LAST30DAYS_PYTHON}" "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/last30days.py" $ARGUMENTS --emit=compact --save-dir="${LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR}" --save-suffix=v3
```

**If you ran Steps 0.55 and 0.75 (agent planning), pass the plan via a tmpfile and add the targeting flags:**

```bash
# Write QUERY_PLAN_JSON to a tmpfile before the engine invocation above.
# parse_plan() reads file paths transparently; this avoids inline-JSON
# shell-quoting hazards (apostrophes in search_query / ranking_query
# strings break single-quoted command-line JSON). Trailing XXXXXX (no
# .json suffix) for BSD/macOS portability — BSD mktemp only substitutes
# X's at the end of the template.
QUERY_PLAN_FILE=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/last30days-plan.XXXXXX")
trap 'rm -f "$QUERY_PLAN_FILE"' EXIT
# >| not >: mktemp already created the file, so a plain > is refused under
# `set -o noclobber` (leaving the plan empty -> deterministic fallback).
cat >| "$QUERY_PLAN_FILE" <<'PLAN_EOF'
{QUERY_PLAN_JSON_FROM_STEP_0.75}
PLAN_EOF
```

**Run this block directly in your shell tool. Do NOT wrap it in `bash -lc '...'` or `zsh -lc '...'`** - the outer single quotes terminate at the first apostrophe inside the heredoc body (a ranking string like `What did Kanye West's album do?`), which aborts the command with a `zsh: unmatched "` error before the engine ever runs. The quoted `<<'PLAN_EOF'` marker already makes the heredoc body apostrophe-safe; the `-lc '...'` wrapper is what breaks it.

Then add to the engine command:

- `--plan "$QUERY_PLAN_FILE"` (path to the file you just wrote)
- `--x-handle={RESOLVED_HANDLE}` (from Step 0.5)
- `--subreddits={RESOLVED_SUBREDDITS}` (broad/category subs, from Step 0.55)
- `--dedicated-subreddits={RESOLVED_DEDICATED_SUBREDDITS}` (entity-home subs, from Step 0.55; pulled in full + floor-exempt)
- `--tiktok-hashtags={RESOLVED_HASHTAGS}` (from Step 0.55)
- `--tiktok-creators={RESOLVED_TIKTOK_CREATORS}` (from Step 0.55)
- `--ig-creators={RESOLVED_IG_CREATORS}` (from Step 0.55)
- `--github-user={RESOLVED_GITHUB_USER}` (from Step 0.5b, person topics only)
- `--github-repo={RESOLVED_GITHUB_REPOS}` (from Step 0.5c, product/project topics only)
- `--trustpilot-domain={RESOLVED_TRUSTPILOT_DOMAIN}` (from Step 0.5d, company/brand topics; the flag also auto-activates Trustpilot)
- Omit any flag where the value was not resolved (empty).

**If you skipped Steps 0.55 and 0.75 (no WebSearch -- OpenClaw, Codex, etc.), add:**
- `--auto-resolve` (the engine will use Brave/Exa/Serper to discover subreddits and context before planning)

**If you skipped Steps 0.55 and 0.75 (no WebSearch), run the command as-is.** The Python engine will plan internally.

Use a **timeout of 300000** (5 minutes) on the Bash call. The script typically takes 1-3 minutes.

The script will automatically:
- Detect available API keys
- Run Reddit/X/YouTube/TikTok/Instagram/Hacker News/Polymarket searches
- Output ALL results including YouTube transcripts, TikTok captions, Instagram captions, HN comments, and prediction market odds

**Read the ENTIRE output.** It contains EIGHT data sections in this order: Reddit items, X items, YouTube items, TikTok items, Instagram Reels items, Hacker News items, Polymarket items, and WebSearch items. If you miss sections, you will produce incomplete stats.

**YouTube items in the output look like:** `**{video_id}** (score:N) {channel_name} [N views, N likes]` followed by a title, URL, **transcript highlights** (pre-extracted quotable excerpts from the video), and an optional full transcript in a collapsible section. **Quote the highlights directly in your synthesis.** When YouTube items also include top comments (default-on once a ScrapeCreators key is set; suppress via `EXCLUDE_SOURCES=youtube_comments`), quote those too with their like counts - they capture how viewers reacted to the video. Transcript highlights and top comments are complementary signals; use both when present. Attribute transcript quotes to the channel name, comment quotes to the commenter. Count them and include them in your synthesis and stats block.

**TikTok items in the output look like:** `**{TK_id}** (score:N) @{creator} [N views, N likes]` followed by a caption, URL, hashtags, and optional caption snippet. Count them and include them in your synthesis and stats block.

**Instagram Reels items in the output look like:** `**{IG_id}** (score:N) @{creator} (date) [N views, N likes]` followed by caption text, URL, and optional transcript. Count them and include them in your synthesis and stats block. Instagram provides unique creator/influencer perspective - weight it alongside TikTok.

## STEP 2: DO WEBSEARCH AFTER SCRIPT COMPLETES

After the script finishes, do WebSearch to supplement with blogs, tutorials, and news.

**Run 2-3 post-engine WebSearch supplements. This is a SEPARATE budget from Step 0.55 pre-research. Pre-research WebSearches DO NOT count against this budget.**

The supplement budget and the Step 0.55 pre-research budget are distinct. Step 0.55 resolves handles/subreddits/hashtags (typically 2-4 searches). Step 2 supplements fill blog/tutorial/news depth the social engine did not surface. Counting one toward the other is the most common reason supplement depth collapses to 1 search and the synthesis loses critical-reaction and long-form analysis context.

- Default: 3 supplements. Drop to 2 if the engine returned 80+ items AND the topic is niche enough that extra web context would be noise.
- Zero supplements is almost never correct. The social-first engine misses long-form analysis, critic reactions, and news context that shape good synthesis. If you are tempted to skip supplements, run at least 2.
- Ceiling: 3. Do not fire 5+ "just in case" - that is what pushed runtimes to 9 minutes on earlier validation.
- Example (Kanye West with 113 engine items): 2-3 supplements covering (1) Billboard/Pitchfork critical reception, (2) Wireless Festival ban news context, (3) optionally a specific claim you want corroborated. Not zero, even though the engine was rich.

For **ALL modes**, do WebSearch to supplement (or provide all data in web-only mode).

Choose search queries based on QUERY_TYPE:

**If RECOMMENDATIONS** ("best X", "top X", "what X should I use"):
- Search for: `best {TOPIC} recommendations`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} list examples`
- Search for: `most popular {TOPIC}`
- Goal: Find SPECIFIC NAMES of things, not generic advice

**If NEWS** ("what's happening with X", "X news"):
- Search for: `{TOPIC} news 2026`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} announcement update`
- Goal: Find current events and recent developments

**If PROMPTING** ("X prompts", "prompting for X"):
- Search for: `{TOPIC} prompts examples 2026`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} techniques tips`
- Goal: Find prompting techniques and examples to create copy-paste prompts

**If GENERAL** (default):
- Search for: `{TOPIC} 2026`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} discussion`
- Goal: Find what people are actually saying

For ALL query types:
- **USE THE USER'S EXACT TERMINOLOGY** - don't substitute or add tech names based on your knowledge
- EXCLUDE reddit.com, x.com, twitter.com (covered by script)
- INCLUDE: blogs, tutorials, docs, news, GitHub repos
- **DO NOT output a separate "Sources:" block** - instead, include the top 3-5 web
  source names as inline links on the 🌐 Web: stats line (see stats format below).
  The WebSearch tool requires citation; satisfy it there, not as a trailing section.

**Options** (passed through from user's command):
- `--days=N` → Look back N days instead of 30 (e.g., `--days=7` for weekly roundup)
- `--quick` → Faster, fewer sources (8-12 each)
- (default) → Balanced (20-30 each)
- `--deep` → Comprehensive (50-70 Reddit, 40-60 X)
- `--register={default,exec,dev,creator,eli5}` → Apply a named audience template to the standard single-topic brief. Pass the flag through to the engine; do not treat its value as topic text. Registers do not apply to JSON, discover, drill, library, or comparison output.

## Step 2.5: Append WebSearch Results to Saved Raw File

**MANDATORY - do not skip this step.** Every post-engine WebSearch supplement you ran in Step 2 MUST be appended to the saved raw file under `LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR` (defaults to `~/Documents/Last30Days`). Skipping this step is a common Opus 4.7 failure mode: the saved file ends at `## Source Coverage` with no appendix, future sessions cannot see what blog/tutorial/news sources informed the synthesis, and the user cannot trace where specific claims came from.

**Self-check (coverage, not strict equality):** The `## WebSearch Supplemental Results` section must cover every web source that informed your synthesis - including pre-research searches whose findings you cited, not only the Step 2 supplements. So the bullet count should be at least the number of post-engine WebSearches you ran, and may exceed it when pre-research web context fed the synthesis (common on `--hiring-signals` runs, where the careers/funding context comes from pre-research). If a source shaped a claim, it gets a bullet. If you ran zero supplements (which plan 005 says is almost never correct), skip this step entirely rather than writing an empty section.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the saved raw file. Locate it via the engine's `[last30days] Saved output to {path}` log line, not a hardcoded path.
   - **Single-topic runs:** append to the one Markdown raw file shown by the saved-output log.
   - **Comparison runs:** locate the `[last30days] Comparison artifact set: main=...; peers=...` line. For compact/Markdown runs, append the same `## WebSearch Supplemental Results` section to every listed per-entity Markdown raw file, because the comparison synthesis draws from all of them and there is no separate merged Markdown raw file. For HTML/JSON-only artifacts, do not append Markdown text to `.html` or `.json`; keep the appendix in the Markdown raw artifacts from the source run.
2. Append a `## WebSearch Supplemental Results` section at the end of each target Markdown raw file.
3. For each WebSearch result, include one bullet in the canonical format (see Format example below).
4. Write the updated file back.

**Format example (canonical, from April 7 archive — match this shape):**

```
## WebSearch Supplemental Results

- **Flowtivity** (flowtivity.ai) — Side-by-side OpenClaw vs Paperclip framework comparison; concludes Paperclip solves coordination, OpenClaw solves execution.
- **Rahul Goyal** (rahulgoyal.co) — Honest three-way review: start with Hermes for simplicity, OpenClaw for tinkering, Paperclip only if running multiple agents.
- **Eigent** (eigent.ai) — Feature-by-feature OpenClaw vs Hermes for founders; Hermes wins on self-improving skills, OpenClaw on ecosystem breadth.
- **The New Stack** (thenewstack.io) — "The race to build AI assistants that never forget" — deep comparison of persistent memory architectures.
- **MindStudio** (mindstudio.ai) — Paperclip vs OpenClaw multi-agent comparison; Paperclip for orchestration, OpenClaw as the individual agent.
```

Each bullet: `- **{Publisher}** ({domain}) — {1-2 sentence excerpt of what you found}`. Publisher is the site name or author; domain is the clean hostname (no protocol, no path). Do not nest sub-bullets. Do not add URLs - the domain in parens is the citation.

This ensures anyone reviewing the raw file sees ALL data that fed into the synthesis, not just the Python engine output.
