### Step 0.5b: Resolve GitHub Username (if topic is a person) — MANDATORY FOR PERSON TOPICS

**MANDATORY when the topic is a person (developer, creator, CEO, founder, engineer, researcher) and WebSearch is available.** Resolving the X handle but NOT the GitHub handle is the documented Peter Steinberger failure mode (2026-04-18). Without `--github-user={handle}`, GitHub search becomes a keyword match across all of GitHub instead of person-mode scoped to `user:{handle}`. The result is typically 5-10 thin unrelated items instead of the person's actual commits, PRs, releases, and top-starred repos. Treat this as a peer step to Step 0.5 (X handle resolution), not an afterthought.

Do the WebSearch:

```
WebSearch("{TOPIC} github profile site:github.com")
```

From the results, extract their GitHub username from URLs like `github.com/{username}`.

**Verify the account is correct:** Check that the profile description or pinned repos match the person you're researching. Common names may return multiple profiles.

Pass to the CLI: `--github-user={username}` (without @)

Worked examples:
- For "Peter Steinberger", a WebSearch for `Peter Steinberger github profile site:github.com` returns @steipete. Pass `--github-user=steipete`.
- For "Matt Van Horn": `--github-user=mvanhorn`
- For "Garry Tan": `--github-user=garrytan`

**Person-mode GitHub tells a different story than keyword search.** Instead of "who mentioned this person in an issue body," it answers: "What are they shipping? Where are they getting merged? What do their own projects look like?" The engine fetches PR velocity, top repos with star counts, release notes, and README summaries.

**Skip this step if:**
- TOPIC is clearly NOT a person (products, concepts, events)
- TOPIC already has `--github-user` specified by the user
- Using `--quick` depth
- WebSearch shows no GitHub profile for this person (report "no GitHub handle found for this person" and proceed without `--github-user` rather than fabricating one)

Store: `RESOLVED_GITHUB_USER = {username or empty}`

**Checkpoint for person topics:** by the time you reach the Research Execution command, for a person topic you MUST have BOTH `RESOLVED_HANDLE` (from Step 0.5) AND `RESOLVED_GITHUB_USER` (from this step) OR an explicit "no X account" / "no GitHub profile" note. The Bash command that follows must include BOTH `--x-handle={handle}` AND `--github-user={handle}` when resolved. A person-topic run that shows only one of the two is a Step 0.5b regression.
